# jsradio
An online radio using moment.js and howler.js.

jsradio uses moment.js to get the time since midnight so audio can be synced across devices giving the impression that it's live. howler.js is used for handling audio files for compatibilty and performance reasons.

the files are pretty large for the radio but i tried to make it work as well as I could.
